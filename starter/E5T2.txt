# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

AWS's IaC templates are CloudFormation templates. Some security scanning tools include:
Dome9 - https://blog.checkpoint.com/2018/05/24/static-code-analysis-infrastructure-code-iac-templates/
Prisma - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-devops-security/secure-your-infrastructure-automation.html

### Example vulnerability

For instance, network security. A security group allowing for traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 is likely too permissive and opens up hacking possibilities.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

AWS Inspector can be used to scan an AMI deployed in EC2.
The Clair tool can be used to scan containers for vulnerabilities - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/scanning-docker-images-for-vulnerabilities-using-clair-amazon-ecs-ecr-aws-codepipeline/

### Example vulnerability

For instance, operating system default configs contain vulnerabilities such as network permissions, root access, unpatched old software.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config is the native tool for configuration vulnerability assessment.
AWS System Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS.

### Example vulnerability

Violations of "least privilege" access rules are common config vulnerabilities. For instance, S3 bucket policy that allows for global writes.
Use of api access keys instead of roles is another common problem that can be detected and prevented by AWS Config.
