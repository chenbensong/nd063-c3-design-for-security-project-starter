# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

GuardDuty found UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce attack, an SSH brute force login attempt, at about 4~5 tries per second from the attack ec2 server. The attack tries to login by guessing the password.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

GuardDuty uses CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs and DNS logs to detect an attack. It uses ML techniques to detect an attack. In this case, it's likely using timeseries anomaly detection algorithms. Very frequent requests from a single ip address is a warning sign.
